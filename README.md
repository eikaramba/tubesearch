# YouTube Word Finder

Find the exact moment a word is spoken in a YouTube video.

This browser extension adds a search bar to the YouTube video page, allowing you to search for words in the video's transcript. The results are displayed with timestamps, and you can click on a result to jump to that specific moment in the video.
